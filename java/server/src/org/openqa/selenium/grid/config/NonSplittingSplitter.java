/**
 * A form of {@link Config} that is generated by looking at fields in the constructor arg that are
 * annotated with {@link ConfigValue}. The class hierarchy is walked from closest to Object to the
 * constructor argument's type, null values are ignored, and the order in which fields are read is
 * not stable (meaning duplicate config values may give different values each time).
 * <p>
 * The main use of this class is to allow an object configured using (for example) jcommander to be
 * used directly within the app, without requiring intermediate support classes to transform flags to
 * config values.
